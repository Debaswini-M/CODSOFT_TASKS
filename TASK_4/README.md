# üé¨ Movie Genre Classification Using Machine Learning

## üìã Project Overview

This project aims to build a machine learning model that predicts the genre of a movie based on its plot summary or other textual information. Using natural language processing (NLP) techniques such as TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) for text feature extraction, the model classifies movie genres using popular classifiers including Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machines (SVM).

## üóÉÔ∏è Dataset: [IMDb Genre Classification Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hijest/genre-classification-dataset-imdb)

The dataset used in this project contains movie plot summaries and their corresponding genre labels. It consists of multiple files including:

- **description.txt:** Movie IDs with their plot summaries.
- **train_data.txt:** Movie IDs with their genre labels for training.
- **test_data.txt:** Movie summaries for testing.
- **test_data_solution.txt:** True genres for test data to evaluate performance.

The data was loaded and merged by movie ID to associate each plot summary with its corresponding genre label.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Techniques

- **Data Preprocessing:**
  - Text cleaning, such as lowercasing.
  - Removal of non-numeric movie IDs to clean the dataset.
  
- **Feature Extraction:**
  - TF-IDF vectorizer transforms text summaries to numeric feature vectors, capturing the importance of words within the corpus.

- **Machine Learning Models:**
  - Multinomial Naive Bayes
  - Logistic Regression
  - Support Vector Machines (LinearSVC)
  
- **Evaluation Metrics:**
  - Accuracy
  - F1-Score
  - classification report

- **Model Performance Plot**

## üìä Results

- The models were trained and compared based on accuracy and F1-score.
- LinearSVC was found to be the best performing classifier during validation.
- The model can predict genres of new movie plots, including animation, thriller, drama, etc.
